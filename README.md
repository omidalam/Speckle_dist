# Goal

We are often interested in finding the relative distance of genomic loci
with respect to a nuclear compartment (e.g. Nuclear Speckles,
Nucleoulus) in our microscopic experiments. The idea behind this module
is formed based on conversations between Dr. Andrew Belmont’s lab
members. Please acknowledge/cite (Our future paper).

# Installation

  - Make sure you have an up-to-date version of FIJI/ImageJ.
  - Download the repository.
  - For Windows: copy the “Loci_Compartment_Distance.py” to "path_to_imageJ\plugins\".
  - For mac: right-click on FIJI in your applications folder -\> Show
    package contents -\> copy the “Loci_Compartment_Distance.py” in
    the plugins folder.
  - Once FIJI restarted, you can find it under the plugins menu.
